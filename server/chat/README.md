# Chat-Application
CS BIU 2023 2nd Semester Project in Advanced Programing 2:

npm install once, and then npm start to run the App.

The App contains a register screen to register new users.

A log in screen for the users to log in.

And then a chat screen, with the ability to add contacts (by name).

Send messages to contacts, and switch between contacts pages.

From the chat screen, the user can log out back to the log in screen.

If the app refreshes, the data is lost. but this doesn't happen when doing all of the actions mentioned before.
